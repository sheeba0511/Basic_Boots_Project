      <p>
        Component is the base class for the React components defined as
        JavaScript classes. Class components are still supported by React, but
        we donâ€™t recommend using them in new code.
      </p>
      <p>
        In react, components are basically two types
        <p> 1- Functional Component(RFC)</p>
        <p> 2- Class Component (RCC)</p>
      </p>
    </>
  );
